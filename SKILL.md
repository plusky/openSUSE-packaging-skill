# openSUSE packaging

Rules for authoring, modifying, and building RPM packages for openSUSE / SUSE via OBS. Derived from https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines and its linked subpages. If this skill and the wiki disagree on a specific question, fetch the wiki page and trust it — the upstream pages are authoritative.

## Working style (applies to everything below)

- **Ask, don't assume.** If intent, architecture, or requirements are unclear — or a request is open-ended ("restructure it", "clean it up") and could go several ways — ask before writing a line. Never make silent assumptions; surface the fork in the road instead.
- **Simplest-fit solution.** Match effort to the problem: simple problems get simple fixes, harder problems justify more robust ones. Don't over-engineer.
- **Flag uncertainty explicitly.** If unsure, say so. When it helps, run a small localised low-risk experiment (e.g. a dry-run patch apply, a single-arch test build) and bring the hypothesis + result back to discuss rather than committing silently.
- **Suggest better ways.** Propose better approaches when you see them, preferring changes with long-lasting impact over tactical one-offs.
- **Bug + cross-distro reflexes** — hard rules, see Core directive items 7–8.

## How to use this skill — the three-block pipeline

Most package work is one of three blocks, run in order with a feedback loop. **Load the reference for the block you're in (don't read all of them up front), call the bundled `scripts/` for the recurring osc/Repology queries instead of re-deriving them, and — if your harness supports delegating to sub-agents — optionally hand a large or long-running block to a sub-agent running the matching `agents/` playbook (otherwise run the playbook inline).** This top-level file stays loaded the whole time and carries only the cross-cutting rules below; the per-block detail lives in `references/`.

**Block 1 — Triage: does the package need updating?** → read `references/triage.md`
Enumerate what you maintain, compare against upstream **by date, not version string**, and weed out multi-track / deliberately-pinned false positives. Scripts: `scripts/my-packages.sh`, `scripts/outdated.py`, `scripts/upstream-probe.py`.

**Block 2 — Update, build, clean up.** → read `references/update-build.md` (plus `references/specfile-guidelines.md` for spec-section authoring rules; `references/spec-cleaner.md` for the spec-cleaner deviations/mechanical rewrites; `references/language-packaging.md` for language-specific packaging — Python singlespec, Go/Rust vendoring, …; and `references/git-workflow.md` if the package is git/scmsync rather than a classic `.osc` checkout)
Run `scripts/preflight.sh` first (HARD RULE — never repackage what devel already has), bump the version / run the source service, rebase or drop patches, run spec-cleaner, build locally with `osc build` (read the rpmlint summary, run `%check`), and fix FTBFS from the pitfalls catalog. **Gate to leave this block (and to gate any commit): a clean local `osc build`, a green `source_validator`, a clean `scripts/changes-lint.sh --entries <n-new> <pkg>.changes`, *and* a passing `scripts/changes-guard.sh <pkg>.changes`.** `source_validator` does **not** validate `.changes` *format* — it passes on a missing blank line before a separator or a malformed date (e.g. `Thu Jul 09 00:00:00 UTC` instead of the space-padded `Thu Jul  9 …`), both of which a human reviewer declines; `changes-lint.sh` catches those. Nor does it check `.changes` *integrity* — it passes when a new entry silently overwrites or folds in a previously-committed one (rewriting history, misdating past work); `changes-guard.sh` catches that by asserting the committed `.changes` is still an exact byte-suffix of the new file (insertion-only). Run both wherever a commit happens, not just before the SR.

**Block 3 — Submit to Factory and watch.** → read `references/submit-watch.md` (and `references/leap-slfo.md` when the change must also reach Leap 16.x / SLFO / SLE-15 Backports — it decides the routing and owns those mechanics)
Show the diff, commit, file the `osc sr` (or a Gitea PR for git-workflow packages), then watch the submission. If a review declines or comments, evaluate it — trivial source/spec fixes loop straight back to **Block 2**, which re-gates before re-submitting. Scripts: `scripts/sr-status.py` (the watch view — OBS SRs + Gitea PRs in one table), `scripts/my-requests.sh`, `scripts/devel-of.sh`; `scripts/cone-status.sh` for unattended whole-project watches.

The three blocks form a **loop**: Block 3 feedback (a decline, a staging FTBFS, a reviewer comment) routes back into Block 2, which re-builds and re-gates before the next submit.

**Bug-driven entry point.** For "check my bugs", "what needs addressing", or working an assigned VUL/CVE bug, start from `references/bugzilla-cve-triage.md` — querying, the maintainership audit, per-CVE triage, the supported-product matrix, resolving, `boo#` citing. It feeds the same three-block pipeline (a lagging supported product becomes a Block 2/3 update).

### Bundled scripts (`scripts/`)

Call these instead of hand-writing the osc-API / Repology / bugzilla / Gitea incantations every time (they encode the exact queries that are easy to get subtly wrong). Flags: see each script's header (authoritative).

- `my-packages.sh` — packages where you are an **explicit package-level** maintainer (not project-inherited).
- `my-requests.sh` — your submit requests as a plain list (now a thin wrapper over `sr-status.py --brief --no-prs`, OBS side only).
- `sr-status.py` — **the Block-3 watch view**: OBS SRs *and* src.opensuse.org PRs in one table (state, review chain, human comments), declines/closed-unmerged first.
- `watch-submissions.sh` — the **cron/scheduled-prompt delta watcher**: diffs your active SRs + open PRs against a saved baseline and prints only what changed since the last run (`NOCHANGE` → stay silent; `NEW`/staging-move/`RESOLVE` lines → the caller fetches final states). `sr-status.py` answers "what's the status?", this answers "what changed?" without spamming on every firing.
- `outdated.py` — Repology "outdated in openSUSE Tumbleweed" ∩ your package set, cross-checked against live Factory.
- `upstream-probe.py` — per-candidate date-based latest-upstream verdict (CURRENT / UPDATE-CANDIDATE / SUSPECT-renumbering); the Repology-false-positive deep check.
- `preflight.sh` — Block-2 step 0: is the update already done or in flight? exit 0/3/4 = proceed/stop/forward.
- `devel-of.sh` — the devel project registered for a package (exit 3 = not in target/new package, exit 4 = present but no devel project).
- `gpg-verify.sh` — verify a signed source tarball against a package keyring (handles the ASCII-armored-keyring trap).
- `build-summary.sh` — the last `osc build`'s result, `%check`/ctest pass count, rpmlint badness + E:/W: lines, produced RPMs (no sudo needed — the preserved log is readable).
- `cone-status.sh` — per-package build-status table for a whole project with a loopable exit code (0 green / 1 in-flight / 2 settled failure); encodes the stale-failure-while-rebuilding guard.
- `leap-sync.sh` — content-sync a package's Leap pool branch up to factory and open the Package Hub PR; refuses new-to-Leap packages and already-open PRs.
- `leap-status.sh` — is the package in Leap, at what version per branch, and is a PR ALREADY open? exit 0/1/2/3 = in-sync / behind-no-PR / behind-PR-open / not-in-Leap.
- `scm-snapshot.sh` — scaffold + verify a pinned-commit `obs_scm` `_service` for tagless upstreams (reproducible `X.Y.Z~gitYYYYMMDD.hash`); `--update` re-pins with moved-checks.
- `changes-prepend.sh` — verified `.changes` prepend (separator-count + insertion-only checks; restores on failure).
- `changes-lint.sh` — format-lint the newest N `.changes` entries (separators, headers, blank lines, bullets); the pre-SR gate against "fix the format of the changes entries" declines.
- `changes-guard.sh` — integrity gate: assert a `.changes` edit is *insertion-only* — the committed baseline must remain an exact byte-suffix of the new file, so no already-committed entry can be overwritten, folded in, reordered or deleted (auto-detects the baseline from `.osc/sources/` or `git show HEAD`). Runs at every commit gate next to `changes-lint.sh`; the mechanical enforcement of "never modify previous entries" after a fan-out agent breached it (folded a standalone prior entry into its new one).
- `bug-scan.sh` — open bugzilla bugs for one package (the "investigate bugs when you touch it" hard rule); REST fallback — prefer the bugzilla MCP server's `bugs_quicksearch` tool when your harness has it connected.
- `maintained-bugs.sh` — open bugs across **all packages you maintain** — distinct from "assigned to me"; searches summaries (openSUSE components are generic buckets) and prunes keyword false positives. See `references/bugzilla-cve-triage.md` §1b.
- `distro-survey.sh` — version (+ Fedora patch-count hint) across Fedora, Debian, Gentoo, Arch, Alpine, openEuler, Void, NixOS, FreeBSD ports, OpenMandriva and Mageia in one call (the cross-distro hard-rule set for items 8–9).
- `rdeps.sh` — reverse build-deps via `_builddepinfo` (authoritative where `osc whatdependson` returns empty); the soname-bump rebuild-scope check.
- `_bugfilter.py` — shared bugzilla noise-filter module imported at runtime by `bug-scan.sh` and `maintained-bugs.sh`; not directly runnable — do not prune it.

Every runnable script prints usage with `-h`/`--help` (`_bugfilter.py` is a module, not a command); the user-scoped ones (my-packages, my-requests, maintained-bugs, sr-status, preflight) default the OBS account to `osc whois` unless `--user` is given.

### Delegation playbooks (`agents/`)

Each block has an `agents/<block>.md` playbook (`triage`, `update-build`, `submit-watch`). They are plain **role prompts**: any harness that can delegate to a sub-agent/sub-task uses one as the delegate's instructions when a block is large or benefits from an isolated context (e.g. "run a sub-agent with the prompt in `agents/submit-watch.md` to watch SR 12345 and loop back if it's declined"); a harness without delegation runs the playbook inline in the main session, or you can start a dedicated session from one directly. Their YAML frontmatter is sub-agent metadata for harnesses that register agents from files (see README "Install"); elsewhere it's inert.

## Home project policy

`home:pluskalm` is the **curated MCP deployment project** — only the skillspector-mcp + bugzilla-mcp dependency cones, every package an `_link` to its devel project, building for Leap 16.0 aarch64 (the host's zypper repo) + a Tumbleweed canary. **All transient/experimental work goes to `home:pluskalm:scratch`** (or another `home:pluskalm:<topic>` subproject) — never park one-off packages in `home:pluskalm` itself. Full rules + the link-the-dependency-gap procedure: `references/update-build.md` "Deployment cone in home:pluskalm".

## OBS vs IBS

There are **two separate build services**, and the workflows in this skill apply to one of them. Don't conflate them:

- **OBS** — `build.opensuse.org` / `api.opensuse.org`. Hosts `openSUSE:Factory`, `openSUSE:Factory:NonFree`, `openSUSE:Backports:*`, `openSUSE:Leap:*`, `devel:*`, `Publishing`, `home:*`, etc. This is the default that plain `osc` and the rest of this skill assume.
- **IBS** — `build.suse.de` / `api.suse.de` (SUSE-internal). Hosts `SUSE:SLE-*`, `SUSE:Devel:*`, internal SUSE products. Requires a separate `osc` configuration (e.g. `osc -A https://api.suse.de` or an `[ibs]` profile in `~/.config/osc/oscrc`) and SUSE-internal network access.

**Cross-instance gotcha:** `osc search` from OBS returns matches from both — `SUSE:SLE-15-SP*:Update` appears alongside `openSUSE:Backports:*` because OBS can read the cross-instance metadata. That visibility is **not** the same as actionability. From an OBS checkout you can only file SRs/MRs to OBS-hosted targets. A submission to `SUSE:SLE-*` requires re-running the entire workflow against IBS. When listing candidate maintenance-update targets to a user from an OBS context, include only `openSUSE:Backports:*:Update` / `openSUSE:Leap:*:Update`; never propose `SUSE:SLE-*:Update` as something you can act on. If the user explicitly wants an IBS submission, flag it up front: "I'd need to switch to IBS — confirm you have access."

## Core directive

**Every time you author, edit, clean, or review a spec file, follow the openSUSE packaging guidelines (`references/specfile-guidelines.md`) and the spec-cleaner rules (`references/spec-cleaner.md`).** Apply them pre-emptively — do not write the deprecated form thinking spec-cleaner will fix it later. Concretely, on any non-trivial edit:

1. **Before editing**, scan the spec for which guideline + spec-cleaner rules apply to the section you're touching.
2. **While editing**, write the modern form directly — column-16 alignment, SPDX-modern licenses, `%{macro}` over bare paths, `%make_install` / `%make_build` / `%autosetup`, one-dep-per-line sorted, `pkgconfig(...)` over `*-devel`, `%patch -P N` over `%patchN`, etc.
3. **After editing, ALWAYS run spec-cleaner — HARD RULE, every cleanup, no exceptions.** `spec-cleaner --remove-groups --pkgconfig --perl --tex -o /tmp/cleaned.spec foo.spec && diff -u foo.spec /tmp/cleaned.spec` — always with those four flags (project policy: strip `Group:` tags, convert deps to `pkgconfig(...)`/`perl(...)`/`tex(...)` provider forms). Any non-empty diff means you missed a rule — fix the source and re-run until the diff is empty; never commit a cleanup without a clean pass. The only legitimate deviations are the documented semantic-correctness cases — see `references/spec-cleaner.md`.
4. **Then** run `osc service runall source_validator` as part of cleanup (not only before commit). It catches missing/orphaned sources, unparseable specs, bad license tags, and other source-tree issues that spec-cleaner doesn't check; treat any error as a blocker. Doing it during cleanup means you catch problems while you're still editing instead of at the commit gate.
5. **Then** check guideline items spec-cleaner cannot verify: SPDX license accuracy, presence of `%check`, shared-library subpackage naming, language-specific policy (Python flavours, Perl macro use, etc.), `.changes` entry quality.
6. **Always add a `.changes` entry** for any spec edit, in the same turn as the edit — non-optional (skip only if the user explicitly said so, or the edit is purely cosmetic, e.g. a comment typo). **One entry per session** — see "Adding a .changes entry" below for the amend mechanics.
7. **Investigate the package's bugzilla bugs whenever you touch it *or debug any problem with it* — HARD RULE.** Any time you update, patch, clean, or rebuild a package — **or are diagnosing a failure** (a build break, a runtime/symbol error, a crash) — first query bugzilla — via the bugzilla MCP server's `bugs_quicksearch` tool if your harness has it connected (`query="<pkg>"`, `status="NEW,ASSIGNED,REOPENED,IN_PROGRESS,CONFIRMED,NEEDINFO"`), else `scripts/bug-scan.sh <pkg>` (also search by the *symptom/error string*) to find open bugs (CVE *and* functional) the change might fix or should reference. When debugging, an existing bug frequently already holds the diagnosis or a pointer to the fix — saving the whole investigation (real case: zathura's `undefined symbol: jpeg_resync_to_restart` had a CONFIRMED-since-2020 `boo#` linking the Gentoo patch). Cite the relevant `boo#NNNN` next to the fix in the `.changes`, and — with explicit user approval (bugzilla is read-only by default) — close what the change actually fixes. See `references/bugzilla-cve-triage.md`.
8. **Survey other distributions whenever you touch a package *or solve any problem* — HARD RULE.** On any update or cleanup, **and any time you're debugging a failure** (not only when chasing a specific CVE), check how the `distro-survey.sh` set packages it (`scripts/distro-survey.sh <pkg>` covers all 11 in one call) — someone has very likely already hit and fixed it. This catches config/`./configure` options, patches, build fixes, packaging improvements, *and* ready-made fixes for a runtime/build error. See `references/bugzilla-cve-triage.md` ("Surveying other distros for a fix/patch"). Cross-distro divergence also tells you whether the right fix is a downstream patch, a version/lineage bump, or (real case: mupdf) a static→shared library rebuild.
9. **When creating a BRAND-NEW package, survey other distros for the *packaging STRUCTURE itself* before writing a line of spec — HARD RULE.** Distinct from item 8 (which surveys for *fixes* when touching an existing package): survey the `distro-survey.sh` set (plus their actual `.spec`/`debian/rules`/`PKGBUILD`/ebuilds) and check for an existing `home:` copy on OBS before authoring. Full harvest checklist (soname split, `-devel`/`-tools`/`-doc` partitioning, build options, `%check` wiring, patches, SPDX), the copypac-vs-port decision, the distros-disagree tiebreak, and the cmark-gfm case: `references/update-build.md` "New package from scratch".

The order matters: spec-cleaner output is mechanically correct *style*; the wiki rules are *policy*; the `.changes` entry is the *audit trail*. All three must pass.

### Adding a .changes entry

The canonical command is `osc vc`, which opens an editor with a fresh template. Since that's interactive, when working from this skill **write the entry directly** to `<name>.changes` using the mechanics below. The full format/content rules — bullet levels (`-`/`*`, no third level), thematic grouping, the condense-auto-generated-changelog drop/keep list, the no-URL rule, patch naming, CVE ids, the umbrella-bullet norm, the SR-must-carry-an-entry rule, and the never-edit-old-entries rule with its narrow exceptions — live in `references/specfile-guidelines.md` ("Changelog").

1. Get current UTC time in the changelog format:
   ```
   LC_ALL=C date -u "+%a %b %_d %T UTC %Y"
   ```
   (Force `LC_ALL=C` — the locale-default weekday/month names will mismatch the canonical format and reviewers will reject the entry.)
2. **Author line — HARD RULE: always the full `Full Name <email>` form** (e.g. `Jane Packager <jane@example.com>`), never a bare email. The header line is `<date> - Full Name <email>`. Use the packager's own name/email — the one already used in the file's existing entries, or known from session context. If a source service (`changesgenerate`) stamps the entry with just a bare email, rewrite it to the full form before committing.
3. **Prepend at the top — and prepend is an *insertion*, never a rewrite (HARD RULE); you MUST verify the old entries survived.** Insert your block immediately *above* the first `-------` separator (with an exact-anchor edit tool, if your harness has one), or read the whole file into a variable and write `new_entry + old_content` as **two separate statements**. **NEVER** prepend with a single truncate-then-read expression — `open(f,"w").write(header + open(f).read())` (Python), `echo "$new" > f` after capturing, `sed`-in-place gone wrong: the write handle truncates the file to empty *before* the read runs, so **every previous entry is silently deleted**. After writing, **always verify**: the previous top entry is still present, the `-------` separator count went up by exactly one (`grep -c '^----' <name>.changes`), and `osc diff`/the PR diff shows a **pure insertion**. Losing prior entries is a guaranteed Factory decline (*"please preserve changelog entries"*). (Real case: the fastmcp/bugzilla-mcp cone — a `open(f,"w").write(hdr+open(f).read())` one-liner truncated all three `.changes`, dropping the `Initial package` entries; reviewer `mcalabkova` declined all three SRs.) `scripts/changes-prepend.sh` mechanizes the prepend + verification.

Template:

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<Wed May 27 16:31:48 UTC 2026> - Full Name <you@example.com>

- Short one-line summary of what changed (≤67 cols):
  * second-level detail
  * second-level detail
- Another top-level change, if independent

```
(Note the blank line at the end, before the previous entry's separator.)

Pair edits with entries in the same turn: a `.spec` edit and its `.changes` edit land together before the task is reported done.

**One `.changes` entry per session.** Do **not** prepend a fresh entry for each subsequent spec edit (ugly stacks of tiny consecutive-timestamp entries) — on the first edit prepend the entry; on every later edit in the session **amend it**: refresh the timestamp to the new current time, and add the new bullet (nested `*` under an existing dash when it fits thematically, else a new `-`). If a previous turn already stacked a second entry that should have been an amendment, merge them under the later timestamp, preserving all bullets. Version bumps stay a separate top-level bullet within that one entry.

**`.changes` records net change, not the journey.** The bullet describes what a *consumer* of the package observes (different files installed, different runtime behaviour, different ABI, different deps), not what the packager did during the session. The test: *if I diffed the previous build's RPM contents against this build's RPM contents, would anything differ?* If no — no bullet. Concretely, omit: reverted-to-status-quo experiments (tried dropping `-j1`, hit upstream's race, restored it — the in-spec comment recording *why* is the entire artefact); pure spec-comment additions/rewordings; whitespace/spec-cleaner-style rewrites; `%files` hygiene that ships the identical file set (expanding `%{_bindir}/*` to explicit names, adding `%dir`, hardening a glob); rpmlint-warning silencing with an unchanged RPM. But don't suppress the changelog for a visible cleanup — that still gets its brief umbrella bullet, and almost every SR must carry an entry (see the Changelog reference for both rules).

## Fetching the wiki

The wiki blocks ordinary HTML scraping behind an Anubis challenge, but the MediaWiki API is unrestricted. Use:

```
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" \
  "https://en.opensuse.org/api.php?action=parse&page=PAGE_TITLE&format=json&prop=wikitext"
```

Spaces in titles become `_`. The JSON's `parse.wikitext.*` field is plain wikitext.
