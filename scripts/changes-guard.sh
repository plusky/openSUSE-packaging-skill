# Assert a .changes edit is INSERTION-ONLY: every already-committed entry must
# survive byte-for-byte. A new entry is prepended at the top; nothing below it
# may change. This is the mechanical enforcement of the hard rule "inserting a
# new .changes entry must leave every existing entry byte-for-byte intact"
# (real breach: a fan-out agent folded a standalone prior entry into its new
# one, deleting that entry's separator+date header — factory-auto passes it,
# but it silently rewrites history and misdates past work).
#
# It is the integrity companion to changes-lint.sh (which checks *format* of
# the newest entries). Run BOTH at every commit gate, alongside source_validator.
#
# Check: the committed baseline must be an exact byte-suffix of the working
# file. That holds iff all new bytes are prepended above the old content —
# a deletion or a mid-file insertion shifts the suffix and trips it.
#
# Usage: changes-guard.sh [--base FILE] <pkg>.changes [more.changes ...]
#   --base FILE  compare against FILE instead of the auto-detected baseline
#                (useful outside a checkout, or to diff two arbitrary versions)
#   Baseline auto-detection order: .osc/sources/<name> (classic osc checkout),
#   .osc/<name> (older osc), then `git show HEAD:<name>` (scmsync/git package).
#   A package with no prior committed .changes (new package) passes trivially.
#
# The one sanctioned exception — adding a boo#/CVE ref to an OLD entry — is a
# deliberate human edit and is expected to fail this guard; do it consciously,
# do not wire an override into the automated flow.
#
#   Exit: 0 = insertion-only (or new file), 1 = a prior entry was modified,
#         2 = usage error.
